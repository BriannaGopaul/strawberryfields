# Release 0.8

## Summary of changes from 0.7

### New features
* You can now prepare multimode states in all backends, via the following new quantum operations in `strawberryfields.ops`:
    - `Ket`
    - `DensityMatrix`
    - `Gaussian`

  Both `Ket` and `DensityMatrix` work with the Fock backends, while `Gaussian` works with all three, applying the Williamson decomposition or, optionally, directly preparing the Gaussian backend with the provided Gaussian state.
* Added Gaussian decompositions to the front-end; these can be accessed via the new quantum operations `Interferometer`, `GaussianTransform`, `Gaussian`. These allow you to apply interferometers, Gaussian symplectic transformations, and prepare a state based on a covariance matrix respectively. You can also query the engine to determine the CV gate decompositions applied.
* Added the cross-Kerr interaction, accessible via the quantum operation `CKgate()`.
* Added utilities for creating random covariance, symplectic, and Gaussian unitary matrices in `strawberryfields.utils`.
* States can now be compared directly for equality - this is defined separately for Gaussian states and Fock basis states.


### Improvements
* The engine logic and behaviour has been overhauled, making it simpler to use and understand.
    - `eng.run()` and `eng.reset()` now allow the user to alter parameters such as `cutoff_dim` between runs.
    - `eng.reset_backend()` has been renamed to `eng.reset()`, and now also implicitly resets the queue.
    - The engine can now be reset even in the case of modes having being added/deleted, with no side effects. This is due to the presence of register checkpoints, allowing the engine to keep track of register changes.
    - `eng.print_applied()` keeps track of multiple simulation runs, by using nested lists.
* A new parameter class is introduced - this is a developmental change, and does not affect the user-facing parts of Strawberry Fields. All parameters passed to quantum operations are 'wrapped' in this parameter class, which also contains several high level mathematical and array/tensor manipulation functions and methods.

# Release 0.7.3

## New features
* Added Gaussian decompositions to the front-end; these can be accessed via the new quantum operations `Interferometer`, `GaussianTransform`, `CovarianceState`. These allow you to apply interferometers, Gaussian symplectic transformations, and prepare a state based on a covariance matrix respectively. You can also query the engine to determine the CV gate decompositions applied.
* Added utilities for creating random covariance, symplectic, and gaussian unitary matrices in `strawberryfields.utils`.

## Improvements
* Created a separate package `strawberryfields-gpu` that requires `tensorflow-gpu`.
* Modified TFBackend to cache non-variable parts of the beamsplitter, to speed up computation.
* Minor performance improvement in `fock_prob()` by avoiding inverting a matrix twice.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed bug #10 by adding the ability to reset the Fock modeMap and GaussianCircuit class
* Fixed bug #11 by reshaping the Fock probabilities if the state happens to be pure states
* Fixed Clements decomposition bug where some phase angles weren't applied
* Fixed typo in displaced squeezed formula in documentation
* Fix to prevent beamsplitter prefactor cache from breaking things if using two graphs
* Fix bug #13, GaussianBackend.state() raises an IndexError if all modes in the state have been deleted.

# Release 0.7.2

## Bug fixes
* Fixed Tensorflow requirements in `setup.py`, so that installation will now work for versions of tensorflow>=1.3,<1.7

## Known issues
* Tensorflow version 1.7 introduces some breaking API changes, so is currently not supported by Strawberry Fields.
